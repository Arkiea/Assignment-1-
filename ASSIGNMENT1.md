# Yield Guild Gaming Research Report

## Overview and Origin:
This paper aim to analyse a blockchain company focused on Play2Earn blockchain gaming named Yield Guild Games (YGG). YGG was founded by three co-founders which include Gabby Dizon (CEO/co-founder), Beryl Li (CFO/co-founder) and Owl of Moistness (a pseudonym, CTO/Co-founder). 
The idea of this company came about with the genesis of play-to-earn game (P2E), a new category in video gaming which can only exist with the advent of blockchain technology and true ownership of digital assets. P2E games allow gamers to earn rewards in tokens, NFTs or other crypto-currency based rewards which they’re free to interchange with other currencies including fiat in the open market. 
The company was funded through an initial seed round led by a prominent crypto-currency investment firm Delphi Digital of $1.35M and an additional $4M from a private round by BitKraft. They have also sold 25M YGG tokens (2.5% of the total supply) at a price of $1.89/token on a decentralized exchange (DEX) SushiSwap platform which raised an additional $12.49M for the treasury. At the time of writing, the price of YGG token has appreciated to ~$6.52 USD which has placed YGG at a circulating market cap of US$444M with a fully diluted cap of US$6.5B. [1]

## Business Activities:
YGG solves a very specific but important problem in the P2E space. Entry into the world of P2E games requires the owner ship of non-fungible tokens. NFTs in the case of P2E games represent an in-game asset wholly owned by the players. NFT’s can include characters, plots of land, weapons, digital pets and so on. NFTs can then be used within the game to earn rewards through in game activities such as going on missions, battling other players or raising/breeding pets. 
The problem arises with the appreciation of NFTs within popular games such as Axie Infinity and Star Atlas. For example, the minimum entry to play Axie Infinity is the ownership of three Axie NFTs which totals around USD$300-450 [2]. However, the cost of high quality Axies can be upwards of USD$1k+. This is often the requirement for players who aim to be competitive in championships or PVP. This cost can be prohibitive for some players, especially those who are new to P2E games or are from lower socio-economic countries where one Axie can represent more than a day/weeks’ worth of a regular full time job [3]
YGG solves this issue by using a Scholarship program which is a revenue-sharing system that allows players to borrow and lend their assets. This benefits the lender of the NFT asset as they take a percentage of the income generated by the utilization of their NFTs. It also benefits the borrower as they can start playing and earning without having to spend any money. Additionally, community managers who work for YGG also gains a percentage of the income by providing new players with mentorship on how to play the game. YGG as a platform takes a percentage of all income generated by the ecosystem to grow their treasury to purchase more NFTs and hire new community managers.
The company’s intended customers are members of the community who have ownership of NFTs, members who are unable to reach the minimum entry and members of the community with expertise in specific P2E games. The only requirement is a working computer and an internet connection.
Some players in 3rd world countries such as the Philipines have been able to earn more than two to three times their annual minimum salary by playing P2E games such as Axie Infinity. 
Apart from using blockchain technology to verify the ownership of NFT. The main advantage that YGG has is its large community and first mover advantage. Being the first of its kind YGG currently amass over 70,000 members in their Discord channel. This includes borrowers, lenders, team members and community managers. YGG is also developing smart contracts to manage their scholarships such as an automated Axie distribution/payout system, a DAO governance voting system using YGG token.
Currently, YGG has chosen the Ethereum blockchain to mint their ERC20 token $YGG [4]. The YGG token is the main utility token of the YGG ecosystem and grants owners the ability to stake for rewards such as: receiving token rewards from in-game guild activities, airdrops of exclusive content, voting rights and participation in the DAO, and as payment method of the ecosystem. YGG also uses Discord to manage its members. Discord allows for the classification of members according to their rank based on the value they’ve provided in the ecosystem. 

## Landscape:
The financial domain in which YGG is in is currently its own class of industry. Never have we been able to prove digital ownership of in-game assets. YGG encompasses an industry which combines decentralized finance, NFTs and video games often referred to as “The Metaverse”. The metaverse often refers to the expansive, inter-connected virtual worlds which exists in the blockchain. Due to it’s decentralized nature, no central entity has complete ownership of The Metaverse. This allows people to create anything they desire in the virtual world. These activities including building on top of an already existing game, buying/selling/trading of digital assets, socializing in a virtual space, even creating entire corporations inside a video game. The metaverse also does not have restrictions, anyone with a computer and an internet connection is free to roam the metaverse.
We are currently in year 0 of the metaverse, people are currently still in the early stages of building out entire virtual universes. Prominent projects now include Axie Infinity, Star Atlas, Sidus NFT Heroes, Mirandus, Echoes of Empire and more.
In 5-10 years from now, I believe that each metaverses will have its own player generated economies as well as its own social and political systems. This will be equivalent to an entire nation state within a virtual world. People have already invested millions of dollars purchasing digital land deeds in games such as Mirandas, a medieval fantasy game created by Gala Games. Recently, two Mirandus NFTs named Citadel of the Sun land deed and Citadel of the Stars land deed have sold for over USD $3.5M each [5]. These NFTs represent land ownership in one of four major kingdoms in the Mirandus metaverse, allowing “kings” to tax their citizens a percentage of all economic activities that happen in their kingdoms. 
Another very popular game called Star Atlas, a space themed massively multiplayer online game is currently selling NFT of spaceships in a Galactic Asset Offering (GAO) [6]. A capital class ship can sell upwards upwards of USD$40,000 in the secondary market. Recent sale of the C9 Capital Class Destroyer in Star Atlas sold 175 ships in less than half an hour. It is projected that owning spaceships can earn owners an annual per annum yield (APY) of around 7-15% by selling resources collected via in-game missions [7]. Recently a Bloomberg article announced that a Star Atlas guild called The Club invested $USD3M dollars in purchasing space ship NFTs [8]. 

## Results:
The genesis of YGG has lowered the barrier of entry to many P2E games. This has opened an entirely new industry of people who can play P2E games for a living. As previously mentioned, gamers in 3rd world countries such as the Philippines are now earning more money playing video games than working a regular 9-5 job. Additionally, YGG has opened the door for other gaming competitors in the market. 
Projects such as Good Guild Games and Astra Guild Ventures aim to imitate and improve on what YGG has built. Other guilds such as The Final Frontier, Interstellar Alliance and Equinox Starfleet has started to build a community around Star Atlas. They aim to create entire corporations inside the game by monetizing the resources located in deep space (a high-risk area of the game which has more resources but any ship NFTs that gets destroyed in this zone is gone forever). Members of their guild include ex or current military personnel, engineers, coders, pro-games, crypto investors and even doctors who have made it their full-time work.
Some core metrics companies in this domain use to measure success include current and diluted market cap, already mentioned in a previous thread. Additionally, according to their medium article posted in July 2021 they’ve generated over 11,777,302 SLP (a token in Axie infinity used to breed NFTs) which his equivalent of US$3.259M in direct revenue. The total amount of SLP since from April to July totalled USD$8.933M. In total since April to July community managers and Axie scholars have earned a total US$5,238,669 [8]. Additionally, their treasury has grown to by US$373M in YGG tokens in July [8]. 
In comparison to other similar guild projects such as Astra Guild Ventures who’ve earnt a monthly revenue of USD$800k in revenue from Axie in-game activity. YGG is still very much ahead of its competition. However, due to the Cambrian explosion of other great P2E games in the market YGG will need to start expanding to other games if they want to continue their growth.
## Recommendations:
One of the biggest issues that YGG and other Guild projects have is their specificity to one game. YGG is mainly focused Axie Infinity and has a huge following in this game. However, gamers will eventually get bored of one game and will want to migrate to a different metaverses. Although YGG has plans to do this as per their recent partnerships with games such as Star Atlas, Guild of Guardians etc their core members are still mostly Axie fans. 
YGG is currently only available on Ethereum as an ERC20 token. Despite being renowned for its security, Ethereum is extremely slow and expensive compared to other chains. Sometimes transaction fees even to purchase YGG tokens on the Ethereum blockchain can cost upwards of US$100 when the network is busy, this will exclude some of their core audience. Due to high gas fees YGG needs to solve this issue by employing a bridge protocol to transfer their ERC20 token to other EVM compatible chains such as Binance Smart Chain, Polygon or Avalanche. An easy solution is to use pTokens DApp, which allows easy cross-chain bridges across multiple chains, even non EVM blockchains.
Until now, YGG has yet to create a smart contract to allow voting and governance. An easy temporary fix for this is to use Collab.land bot on Discord. This allows Discord to connect to the blockchain using an API. This enables YGG token holders to gain access to special channels on their discord channel which can then be used specifically for voting. 
Another problem is that currently, Axie scholarship isn’t decentralized at all. It requires a third party (YGG) to escrow NFTs of borrowers/lenders. There can potentially be room here for a smart contract to automate all this. Although technically I think it’ll be challenging and is a million-dollar question. 
Although it’ll be less of a problem in games such as Axie where NFTs can’t be destroyed, borrowing/lending could prove disastrous in games such as Star Atlas where a player can drive their rented ship into deep space and destroy the ship forever. Therefore, I believe an insurance market for NFTs will be huge in the future. This ensures ship owners in Star Atlas the guarantee that their ship will be protected against damages or loss. The smart contract may potentially be able to even limit ship lenders from entering deep space altogether. It may be possible to create a smart contract that acts as an “escrow” that allows specific restrictions from the lender/borrower’s wallet to certain in-game activities. This can be done using Solidity on an EVM or Rust on Solana.
